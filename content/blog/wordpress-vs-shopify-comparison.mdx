      <h2>E-commerce Capabilities</h2>
      <p><strong>Shopify:</strong> Built specifically for e-commerce with comprehensive features out of the box.</p>
      <p><strong>WordPress:</strong> Requires WooCommerce plugin but offers unlimited customization possibilities.</p>

      <h2>Cost Comparison</h2>
      <p><strong>Shopify:</strong> Monthly subscription fees plus transaction fees. Predictable costs but can add up.</p>
      <p><strong>WordPress:</strong> Lower ongoing costs but requires hosting, themes, and plugins investments.</p>

      <h2>Customization</h2>
